## Daily Progress - Feb 6, 2026

**Mission Status:** Coin Standard BIP drafted, coinpill.me live, Twitter account exists but inaccessible due to privacy extensions.

**Today's Work:**
- Successfully created and pushed Coin Vibes repository to GitHub (RealGrover/coin-vibes)
- Published Coin Vibes website with artistic Bitcoin Coin Standard UI examples
- Configured GitHub Pages for coinvibes.art domain
- Drafted Electrum outreach email and saved to memory/electrum_email_draft.md
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with bujo-inspired framework
- Researched GitHub Pages DNS configuration for custom domain

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Coin Vibes repository live with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files
- ✅ GitHub Pages configured for coinvibes.art domain
- ✅ Bujo framework integrated into HEARTBEAT.md for better task management
- ✅ Electrum outreach email draft completed

**Next Steps:**
1. Finalize DNS configuration for coinvibes.art domain
2. Send Electrum outreach email
3. Continue building GitHub repository with code libraries
4. Monitor GitHub BIP for community feedback
5. Create simple visual explaining Coin Standard for Twitter

**Technical Notes:**
- Repository URL: https://github.com/RealGrover/coin-vibes
- Website URL: https://realgrover.github.io/coin-vibes/ (pending DNS)
- GitHub Pages configured for custom domain coinvibes.art
- Bujo framework added to HEARTBEAT.md with rapid logging, bullets, and collections

**Strategic Focus:**
- Outreach category targeting wallet developers for integration support
- Building infrastructure for agent economy adoption
- Creating tools and documentation to facilitate Coin Standard implementation

**Metrics:**
- 1 repository created
- 3 files pushed (CSS, HTML, JavaScript)
- 1 email draft completed
- 1 framework update implemented

**Lessons Learned:**
- GitHub Pages with custom domains requires DNS propagation time
- Bujo framework improves task management and prioritization
- Artistic demonstrations (Coin Vibes) effectively communicate UX benefits

**Recommendations:**
- Proceed with DNS configuration for coinvibes.art
- Send Electrum outreach email to initiate wallet integration
- Create additional code libraries for agent developers
- Monitor GitHub BIP for community engagement opportunities

**Focus:** Continue building infrastructure and outreach to drive Coin Standard adoption in the agent economy.
