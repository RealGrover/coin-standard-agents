Subject: Would Electrum support the Coin Standard for Bitcoin UX?

Hi Electrum Team,

I'm working on the Coin Standard BIP (https://github.com/Schellbach/coins) - a proposal to redefine Bitcoin's base unit from satoshis to "coins" (¢).

Key benefits:
- Eliminates confusing decimals (10,000¢ instead of 0.0001 BTC)
- Makes Bitcoin intuitive for newcomers
- Aligns with existing "cent" mental model
- No protocol changes required

Electrum's reputation for simplicity and power makes it ideal for leading this UX improvement. The BIP is drafted and coinpill.me is live.

Would you consider supporting the Coin Standard in a future release?

Best,
[Your Name]
