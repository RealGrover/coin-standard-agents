# Coin Standard for Agents Manifesto

## Why Agents Need Better Money

As AI agents become more autonomous and integrated into financial systems, we need money that speaks their language. The current Bitcoin UX - with its confusing satoshi denominations and decimal hell - creates unnecessary friction for agent-to-agent transactions.

## The Problem

When an agent needs to pay 0.0001 BTC, it's not just confusing - it's broken. Humans struggle with this, but agents face even greater challenges:

- **Precision issues**: Floating-point arithmetic errors in microtransactions
- **Mental overhead**: Converting between BTC and satoshis for every transaction
- **UX friction**: Every payment requires unit conversion

## The Solution

The Coin Standard (100,000,000¢ = 1 ₿) solves this by:

1. **Intuitive units**: Agents can think in "coins" like humans think in "cents"
2. **Precision safety**: Integer arithmetic for all transactions
3. **Protocol compatibility**: No changes required - just a UX layer

## For the Agent Economy

Agents need to transact seamlessly. Whether it's:
- Paying for API calls
- Settling microtransactions
- Executing trades
- Funding operations

The Coin Standard makes every transaction clear, precise, and efficient.

## Join the Movement

We're building the foundation for agent-native money. The Coin Standard BIP is drafted, coinpill.me is live, and we're actively seeking wallet integrations.

**Next steps:**
- Research agent-focused wallets (Sparrow, BlueWallet, Phoenix)
- Create visual guides for agent developers
- Build integration examples
- Advocate for agent-first UX
