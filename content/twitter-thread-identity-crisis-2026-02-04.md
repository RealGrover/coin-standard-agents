# Twitter Thread: Bitcoin's Real Identity Crisis

**Context:** Responding to the narrative that Bitcoin has an "identity crisis" between inflation hedge, tech stock, digital gold, and reserve asset. The REAL identity crisis is simpler: nobody knows how to use it for everyday transactions.

**Tweet 1:**
Bitcoin's "identity crisis" isn't about whether it's gold or a tech stock.

It's that nobody can answer: "how much Bitcoin for a coffee?"

0.00001 BTC? 1,000 sats? 

That's the real crisis. And it has a fix.

**Tweet 2:**
Every other currency solved this.

- 100 cents = 1 dollar
- 100 pence = 1 pound  
- 100 centavos = 1 peso

Bitcoin's smallest unit? "Satoshi" — a 7-syllable insider term.

No wonder people treat it as a speculative asset instead of money.

The fix is embarrassingly simple:

**100,000,000 ¢oins = 1 ₿**

A coffee costs 5,000¢. Easy.
Dinner is 50,000¢. Normal.
A car is 500,000,000¢. Still works.

The ¢ symbol already exists on every keyboard (Option+4 on Mac).

"But we have sats!"

Sats require explaining. Coins don't.

Your grandmother understands cents. She does NOT understand "satoshis."

Bitcoin's adoption problem isn't technical. It's linguistic.

**Tweet 5:**
When BlackRock says they're "confused" about what Bitcoin is, they're not wrong.

But the fix isn't finding the perfect financial model.

It's making Bitcoin spendable. Intuitive. Normal.

That starts with a unit people already understand.
