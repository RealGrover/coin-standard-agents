# Twitter Thread Draft: The Problem with Sats

## Thread 1/5

The "sats" denomination is failing.

Bitcoiners pushed satoshis to fight unit bias. The idea: 47,000 sats feels better than 0.00047 BTC.

But there's a problem nobody talks about.

## Thread 2/5

Sats are still too small.

At $100K/BTC:
- Coffee = 5,000 sats
- Lunch = 25,000 sats  
- Rent = 15,000,000 sats

We're still dealing with big, unwieldy numbers. We just moved the decimal point.

## Thread 3/5

Enter coins (¢).

100,000,000¢ = 1 ₿

At $100K/BTC:
- Coffee = 5¢
- Lunch = 25¢
- Rent = 15,000¢

Familiar. Intuitive. No mental math required.

## Thread 4/5

The three-symbol system:

₿ → Large amounts (savings, treasuries)
¢ → Everyday use (payments, wages, prices)
sats → Technical layer (fees, precision)

Each has its place. Each serves a purpose.

## Thread 5/5

The goal isn't to replace sats.

It's to give Bitcoin a unit that feels natural for actual humans making actual purchases.
