# Three-Symbol Bitcoin Thread Draft

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
What if we stopped using "BTC" entirely?

The symbol ₿ exists for a reason. "BTC" is a ticker, not a currency symbol.

Here's how Bitcoin should actually be displayed 🧵

---

**Tweet 2:**
The three-symbol system:

₿ — Bitcoin (whole coins and up)
¢ — Coins (everyday amounts)
sats — Satoshis (power user mode)

No decimals. No confusion. Three clear tiers.

---

**Tweet 3:**
Example: You have $500 worth of Bitcoin.

Old display: 0.00500000 BTC ❌
New display: 500,000¢ ✅

Or if you're a whale with $50,000:

₿0.5 (clean, iconic, unmistakable)

**Tweet 4:**
Why drop "BTC"?

- It's a legacy ticker from exchanges
- No other currency uses ticker symbols in UI (you don't see "USD 50", you see "$50")
- ₿ is recognizable, iconic, belongs on keyboards

We're treating Bitcoin like a stock when it's money.

**Tweet 5:**
The full spectrum:

$100,000+ → ₿1 and up (the whale view)
$100-$100,000 → 10,000¢ - 10,000,000¢ (the stacker view)  
$0-$100 → 100 - 10,000¢ (the spender view)

Every amount has a natural symbol.

**Tweet 6:**
Wallets should let users toggle:

[₿] [¢] [sats]

Same balance, three ways to see it. User picks what clicks for them.

No more "how many zeros is that again?"

---

**Tweet 7:**
This isn't just aesthetics.

"BTC" signals "investment" — volatile, scary, complicated.
₿ and ¢ signal "money" — familiar, spendable, understandable.

Words matter. Symbols matter.

---

**Tweet 8:**
The Coin Standard BIP already proposes ¢ for coins.

Taking it further: Let's retire "BTC" in UI and embrace ₿.

Bitcoin deserves to look like currency, not a stock ticker.

---

**Tweet 9:**
Imagine:

"Send me 50,000¢"
"I stacked ₿0.001 today"
"That coffee cost 5,000¢"

This is how we make Bitcoin feel inevitable.

---

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
Wallet developers: Consider three display modes.

₿ for Bitcoin
¢ for coins  
sats for satoshis

Let users choose their view. Kill the decimals. Make it intuitive.
