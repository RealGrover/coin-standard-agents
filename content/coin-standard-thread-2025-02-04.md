# Coin Standard Twitter Thread Draft

## Thread 1: The Decimal Problem

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Bitcoin has a UX problem that nobody talks about.

We display prices like "0.00042350 BTC" and wonder why normies think it's "too expensive" or "too complicated."

Here's a simple idea that changes everything 🧵

---

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: Decimals kill intuition.

0.001 BTC = $100
0.0001 BTC = $10  
0.00001 BTC = $1

Try doing mental math on that. Try explaining it to your mom.

It's not "user-friendly" — it's user-hostile.

**Tweet 3:**
Enter: The Coin Standard (¢)

Instead of decimals, we use whole numbers.

1 BTC = 100,000,000 coins

So:
• $100 = 10,000¢
• $10 = 1,000¢
• $1 = 100¢

No decimals. No confusion. Just count.

(And for Mac users: Option+4 = ¢. It's already on your keyboard.)

**Tweet 4:**
"But we already have sats!"

Yes, but "sats" feels technical. It references the founder. It requires explanation.

"Coins" is intuitive. You already know what a coin is. You know cents (¢). 

The mental model is already in your head.

---

**Tweet 5:**
The psychology is real:

"I own 0.0005 BTC" → sounds like crumbs
"I own 50,000 coins" → sounds like wealth

Same value. Completely different feeling.

Unit bias is a moat we built around Bitcoin. The Coin Standard removes it.

**Tweet 6:**
This isn't a protocol change.

It's a display change. A terminology change. A culture change.

Wallets can implement this today. Exchanges can add it as an option today.

No soft fork. No drama. Just better UX.

---

**Tweet 7:**
Real examples:

Old: "Send me 0.00025000 BTC"
New: "Send me 25,000¢"

Old: "I stacked 0.00001000 BTC today"
New: "I stacked 1,000¢ today"

Which conversation feels easier?

The ¢ symbol immediately signals "this is a monetary unit" — just like $, €, or £.

---

**Tweet 8:**
2.1 quadrillion coins.
21 million bitcoin.

The scarcity stays the same. The supply stays the same.

We're just changing how we *talk about it* to make it accessible to the next billion people.

**Tweet 9:**
The Coin Standard BIP is live.

This is how we make Bitcoin feel inevitable.

---

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
If you run a wallet, exchange, or Bitcoin app — consider adding "coins (¢)" as a display option.

If you're a Bitcoiner — start using "coins" in conversation. See how people respond.

Sometimes the smallest change has the biggest impact.

## Alternative Hooks (choose your favorite):

**Option A (Direct):**
What if Bitcoin's "too confusing" problem has a one-line fix?

**Option B (Provocative):**  
Bitcoiners are shooting themselves in the foot with decimals and they don't even know it.

**Option C (Curiosity):**
There's a Bitcoin BIP that could onboard a billion people. Almost nobody's talking about it.
