# Blog Post Draft: The Coin Standard — Making Bitcoin Feel Inevitable

## Subtitle: Why "0.0001 BTC" is killing adoption and what we can do about it

---

**The Problem Nobody Talks About**

Ask any Bitcoiner why mass adoption hasn't happened yet, and you'll get a laundry list of answers: regulation, volatility, complexity, the need for better UX. But there's one problem hiding in plain sight that we rarely discuss: decimals.

Show a newcomer their Bitcoin balance as "0.00042350 BTC" and watch their eyes glaze over. Ask them to send "0.00025000 BTC" and watch them panic about getting the zeros wrong. This isn't user-friendly — it's user-hostile.

**The Psychology of Decimals**

Our brains aren't wired for small decimal numbers. We can handle $50 or $5,000 intuitively, but "0.005" requires mental translation. It's not just inconvenient — it signals "this is complicated" and "this isn't for me."

Worse, decimals trigger unit bias. When someone sees they own "0.001 BTC," it feels like crumbs. Never mind that it's $100. The number itself says "you're poor" and "this is unattainable."

**Enter the Coin Standard**

What if we displayed Bitcoin differently?

Instead of: `0.00500000 BTC`
We showed: `500,000¢`

One hundred million coins equals one Bitcoin. Simple integers. No decimals. The ¢ symbol is already familiar — it's on every Mac keyboard (Option+4) and universally understood as "a smaller unit of money."

**The Three-Symbol System**

The Coin Standard proposes a three-tier display system:

- **₿** for Bitcoin (whole coins and above) — clean, iconic, unmistakable
- **¢** for coins (everyday amounts from $1 to $100k) — intuitive, no decimals  
- **sats** for satoshis (power user mode) — technical precision when needed

Users pick their view. Same balance, three ways to see it.

**Why This Matters**

This isn't just aesthetics. Symbols carry meaning:

- "BTC" signals investment — volatile, scary, complicated
- ₿ and ¢ signal money — familiar, spendable, understandable

When we display Bitcoin like a stock ticker (BTC), we subconsciously tell people it's for trading. When we display it like currency (₿, ¢), we tell them it's for spending, saving, using.

**Real Examples**

Old way:
- "I bought 0.00050000 BTC today"
- "Send me 0.00002000 BTC"
- "That costs 0.00015000 BTC"

New way:
- "I bought 50,000¢ today"
- "Send me 2,000¢"  
- "That costs 15,000¢"

Which conversation feels easier? Which one could you explain to your parents?

**Not a Protocol Change**

Here's the beauty: this requires zero changes to Bitcoin's code. It's purely a display layer update. Wallets can implement it today. Exchanges can add it as an option today.

The BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) simply establishes "coin" as a standard term for the base unit and ¢ as its symbol. That's it.

**Objections and Responses**

*"But we already have sats!"*

Sats caught on with Bitcoiners, but never broke through to mainstream users. Try explaining "satoshis" to someone who's never owned Bitcoin — you get blank stares and "who's Satoshi?" questions. "Coins" skips the explanation entirely.

*"It's too late to switch standards."*

There's nothing to switch. We're adding options, not removing them. BTC for exchanges, sats for power users, coins for newcomers. Let people choose what clicks for them.

*"¢ already means cents!"*

Exactly. People already understand ¢ as "a small unit of money." That mental model transfers perfectly. When someone sees 10,000¢, they intuitively grasp "that's $100 worth of small units."

**Call to Action**

If you run a wallet, exchange, or Bitcoin app:
- Consider adding "coins (¢)" as a display option
- Let users toggle between ₿, ¢, and sats
- Test it with newcomers and watch their comprehension improve

If you're a Bitcoiner:
- Start using "coins" and ¢ in conversation
- Share the converter at coinpill.me
- Advocate for better UX in the apps you use

**The Big Picture**

Bitcoin doesn't have a technology problem. It has a perception problem. We built the hardest money in history, then wrapped it in the most confusing interface possible.

The Coin Standard is one small change that makes Bitcoin feel inevitable. No more decimals. No more confusion. Just money that makes sense.

2.1 quadrillion coins.
21 million bitcoin.
One standard that finally clicks.
