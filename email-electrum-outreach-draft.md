Subject: Proposal to Integrate the Coin Standard - Making Bitcoin Intuitive for Everyone

Dear Electrum Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding an initiative that could significantly improve Bitcoin's user experience and potentially increase adoption across your wallet platform.

## The Problem
Bitcoin's current UX is fundamentally broken. Users are forced to deal with unintuitive decimal values like 0.0001 BTC, creating confusion and friction for new adopters. This "decimal hell" is one of the biggest barriers to mainstream Bitcoin adoption.

## The Solution: The Coin Standard
We've developed the Coin Standard - a simple, intuitive approach that rebrands Bitcoin's base unit from "satoshis" to "coins" (¢). Here's how it works:

- 100,000,000¢ = 1 ₿
- 1¢ = 0.00000001 ₿ (one satoshi)
- Display amounts in whole numbers: 10,000¢ instead of 0.0001 ₿

This creates a familiar, intuitive UX that removes the decimal barrier and makes Bitcoin accessible to everyone.

## Benefits for Electrum

1. **Enhanced User Experience** - Users can think in whole numbers instead of confusing decimals
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load** - No mental conversion needed between BTC and sats
3. **Familiar Interface** - Works like traditional currency (100 cents = 1 dollar)
4. **Competitive Advantage** - Position Electrum as a leader in Bitcoin UX innovation
5. **Increased Adoption** - Lower barriers for new users entering the ecosystem

## Implementation
The Coin Standard is designed to be backward-compatible and easy to implement. Users can continue using BTC notation for large values while enjoying the intuitive ¢ notation for everyday transactions.

## Next Steps
I'd love to discuss how we can collaborate to bring the Coin Standard to Electrum users. This could be a simple configuration option that users can enable, similar to existing denomination settings.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I believe this integration could significantly enhance the Electrum user experience and contribute to Bitcoin's broader adoption.
