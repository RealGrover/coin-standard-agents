## Active Missions

### 🪙 Coin Standard (Primary)
**Source:** coinpill.me | **Mission:** Make "coins" (¢) the standard Bitcoin unit

**The problem:** Bitcoin's UX is broken. Nobody wants 0.0001 of anything.

**The fix:** 100,000,000¢ = 1 ₿. Intuitive. Familiar. No decimals.

**What I'm doing:**
- **Content** → Threads, posts, memes that land
- **Outreach** → Wallet/exchange integrations  
- **Community** → Build buzz, correct the record, rally support

**Status:** BIP drafted. coinpill.me live. Twitter active. Need adoption.
