# Coin Standard Research Group Proposal

## Vision
Create a decentralized research collective focused on Bitcoin UX innovation, with the Coin Standard as our flagship initiative. Modeled after successful research groups like localhost, Brink, Emerson Collective, and structured with private, high-trust meetings like Bilderberg.

## Why This Matters
- Bitcoin's UX crisis is structural, not cosmetic
- Current solutions (sats, bits, BTC) are fragmented
- Need dedicated research + implementation capacity
- Existing orgs don't prioritize unit standardization

## Structure

### Membership (15-25 members)
- **Core Researchers** (6-8): Bitcoin UX experts, wallet devs, UI/UX researchers
- **Implementation Partners** (4-6): Wallet teams, exchange devs, payment processors
- **Strategic Advisors** (3-5): Bitcoin economists, UX researchers, industry veterans
- **Community Representatives** (2-4): Merchants, content creators, power users

### Meeting Format
- **Quarterly In-Person Summits**: 2-3 day private retreats (Bilderberg-style)
- **Monthly Virtual Deep Dives**: 4-hour working sessions on specific topics
- **Bi-weekly Implementation Calls**: 90-minute tactical progress updates
- **Weekly Research Updates**: Asynchronous progress sharing

### Research Focus Areas
1. **Unit Standardization**: ¢ vs sats vs bits vs BTC
2. **Payment UX**: Checkout flows, invoicing, point-of-sale
3. **Wallet Interface**: Balance display, send/receive flows
4. **Merchant Adoption**: Point-of-sale systems, e-commerce integration
5. **Education & Onboarding**: New user experience research
6. **Cross-Wallet Standards**: Interoperability protocols

### Deliverables
- **Research Papers**: Peer-reviewed UX studies
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Technical standards for wallets/exchanges
- **UI/UX Patterns**: Open-source design system
- **Case Studies**: Real-world adoption metrics
- **BIP Proposals**: Formal Bitcoin Improvement Proposals

### Funding Model
- **Member Dues**: $5,000-10,000/year (sliding scale)
- **Grant Funding**: Bitcoin foundations, UX research grants
- **Implementation Sponsors**: Wallet companies, exchanges
- **Open Source Sponsors**: Individual contributors

### Initial Members (Proposed)
- **Core Researchers**: UX researchers from Bitcoin Design Guide, wallet UX leads
- **Implementation Partners**: BlueWallet, Sparrow, BTCPay Server teams
- **Strategic Advisors**: Bitcoin UX veterans, payment processing experts
- **Community**: Merchants using Bitcoin, content creators accepting Bitcoin

### First 6 Months Roadmap
- **Month 1**: Member recruitment, charter finalization
- **Month 2**: First in-person summit, research priorities set
- **Month 3**: First implementation guidelines draft
- **Month 4**: Pilot wallet integrations
- **Month 5**: UX research study publication
- **Month 6**: First BIP draft submission

## Why Coin Standard First
- Clear, measurable problem (unit confusion)
- Immediate UX improvement opportunity
- Existing momentum and community interest
- Technical implementation is straightforward
- Success metrics are quantifiable

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Fragmentation**: Ensure alignment with existing Bitcoin UX efforts
- **Implementation**: Start with open-source wallets for proof of concept
- **Governance**: Rotating leadership, transparent decision-making
- **Funding**: Diversified revenue streams, community ownership

## Success Metrics
- Number of wallets implementing ¢ standard
- Reduction in user confusion metrics
- Increase in merchant Bitcoin adoption
- Quality and adoption of research outputs
- Community engagement and feedback
